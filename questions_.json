    "Explanation": "Idempotency ensures that multiple executions of the same operation produce the same result without side effects. Using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) to track requests allows Lambda functions to detect and prevent duplicate processing, ensuring that retries or concurrent invocations don't cause unintended duplicate actions.",

    "QuestionText": "A company hosts its web application backend on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). The application's Amazon ECS tasks run behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The application supports three environments: production, testing, and development. The application uses the ALB to route traffic to the correct environment. The company has configured three listener rules for the ALB to forward traffic to a different target group based on the port number (Port 80 for production target group, Port 8080 for testing target group, and Port 8081 for development target group). The company decides to migrate the application backend to a serverless architecture by using an Amazon API Gateway API backed by AWS Lambda functions. The company plans to use the URI path pattern to access the desired environment instead of the port number. The company has created the Lambda functions for the application backend. Each Lambda function has three aliases (production, testing, and development).  Which option includes the next steps the company must take to complete the process?",
    "Options": [
      "Create an API Gateway API and configure the routes to use Lambda proxy integration. Target the corresponding Lambda function Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is concatenated with the expression ${stageVariables.LambdaAlias}. Modify the Lambda resource-based policy by adding the permission lambda:InvokeFunction. Create production, testing, and development stages. Add the LambdaAlias stage variable to the corresponding stage.",

    "QuestionText": "A company uses an AWS Lambda function to call a third-party REST endpoint. Personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed upon a successful request. The third party that manages the REST endpoint requires the company to change the API key that the company uses to invoke the endpoint every 4 months. The company retrieves the API key by calling an endpoint that the third party owns. The endpoint uses basic authentication (username and password). The new API key is available and active one month prior to the inactivation of the old API key. When the company retrieves the new API key, the company needs to store the key for use in future invocations of the REST endpoint. The company needs a secure solution that eliminates downtime while the company sets up the new API key. Which solution will meet these requirements?",

      "Store the API key in Parameter Store, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, as a SecureString. Configure rotation to obtain the new API key from the third party and to update the parameter value.",
