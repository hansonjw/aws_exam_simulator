    "Explanation": "Idempotency ensures that multiple executions of the same operation produce the same result without side effects. Using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) to track requests allows Lambda functions to detect and prevent duplicate processing, ensuring that retries or concurrent invocations don't cause unintended duplicate actions.",
